# Frameling

A friendly desktop tool for drawing and animating 2D art, made for vector and pixel art alike. Draw frame by frame or tween between poses, then export to video, GIFs, sprite sheets, Godot, and natively into Interactives.

Early days: what's here is the empty app shell and the build pipeline. The plan lives on the project board (project `frameling`, doc `evaluation`).

## Get it

Every pull request into `main` builds the app for all three systems. Open the pull request's **Checks**, then **Build desktop apps**, and download it from **Artifacts** at the bottom of the run:

| System | File |
|---|---|
| Windows | `Frameling-<version>-setup-x64.exe` (installer) or `...-portable-x64.exe` (runs without installing) |
| macOS | `Frameling-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg` (Apple silicon) or `...-mac-x64.dmg` (Intel) |
| Linux | `Frameling-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (make it executable, then run it) |

The builds aren't signed yet, so on Windows click **More info → Run anyway**, and on macOS right-click the app and choose **Open** the first time.

## Work on it

Needs Node 22.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # opens the app with hot reload
npm test               # tests
npm run build          # type check, then build into dist/
npm run dist           # installers for this system, into release/
```

### Install on this Linux machine

```bash
npm run install-local                 # build the AppImage and install it
npm run install-local -- --no-build   # install the last build without rebuilding
```

This copies the AppImage to `/mnt/109313D2109313D2/lutris-applications/frameling/frameling.AppImage`. If Frameling is running from there, the script closes it first so the file can be replaced. Set `FRAMELING_INSTALL_DIR` to install somewhere else.

## How it's put together

- `src/main/`: the Electron main process (windows, menus, files).
- `src/preload/`: the small, safe bridge between the page and the desktop (`window.frameling`).
- `src/renderer/`: the app's interface (React and TypeScript, built with Vite).
- `scripts/`: dev, build and local install scripts.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: the Windows, macOS and Linux builds.

Branches: work happens on `development`, which reaches `main` through pull requests, and each pull request builds the apps.
